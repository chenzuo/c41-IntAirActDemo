# What is ZeroConfigNetServices?

A fork of the Google Code project
[zeroconfignetservices](http://code.google.com/p/zeroconfignetservices/).

Copied description:

Bringing Bonjour technology to .Net developers. This project provides a wrapper
around Apple's mDNS Windows library (dnssd.dll) which provides two .NET classes,
very similar to Cocoa's NSNetService and NSNetServiceBrowser.

Originally written by David Hammerton, updated and maintained by Deusty Designs
and the .Net development community.
